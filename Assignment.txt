Introduction
For this project, you will create a personal portfolio website to demonstrate your ability to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and resolve software problems in web development environments. You will create three HTML pages: a résumé, a cover letter, and a career goals page. As you make your website, you will use one external style sheet for the design and layout of your site. A zip file should be used to upload the personal portfolio.



You will write your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code—no frameworks will be allowed. Do not use online media links—all image, audio, and video files must be stored locally with your code.

 

Your submission should include:

•   3 HTML files: resume.html, cover-letter.html, and career-goals.html

•   1 external CSS file: master.css or style.css

•   At least 1 image file (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, or .gif)

•   1 audio file (.mp3 or .wav)

•   1 video file (.mp4, .mov, or .mpeg)

Requirements
Your submission must represent your original work and understanding of the course material. Most performance assessment submissions are automatically scanned through the WGU similarity checker. Students are strongly encouraged to wait for the similarity report to generate after uploading their work and then review it to ensure Academic Authenticity guidelines are met before submitting the file for evaluation. See Understanding Similarity Reports for more information.

Grammarly Note:
Professional Communication will be automatically assessed through Grammarly for Education in most performance assessments before a student submits work for evaluation. Students are strongly encouraged to review the Grammarly for Education feedback prior to submitting work for evaluation, as the overall submission will not pass without this aspect passing. See Use Grammarly for Education Effectively for more information.



Note: The file size limit for your entire submission cannot exceed 200 MB. Each individual file cannot be larger than 16 MB



It is recommended that you compress your required files into a single archive file (.zip, .rar, .tar, or .7z) named using your last name (e.g., smith_portfolio.zip).
